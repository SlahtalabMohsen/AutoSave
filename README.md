# AutoSave Script
 
# This script automates the process of pressing Ctrl+S at regular intervals. Useful for scenarios where frequent manual saving is necessary.

# How to run:
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Install the necessary libraries by running:
   
   pip install keyboard
   
4. Run the script using Python:
   
   python autosave.py
   

# Functionality:
This simple script uses the keyboard and time modules in Python to press the Ctrl+S key combination at regular intervals. The save() function is defined to simulate the Ctrl+S key press using keyboard.press_and_release('ctrl+s'). This function is called in a loop using while True, and it prints a message indicating that Ctrl+S has been pressed and then pauses execution for 10 seconds using time.sleep(10).

Please note that this script will run indefinitely until manually stopped, executing the save function every 10 seconds as per the current configuration.
